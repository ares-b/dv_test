# DV Test - Condition Tree File Processor

Deserializes a Condition tree file into a Binary Tree and :
1. Removes contradictive paths
2. Prunes valid paths by flattening and simplifying their conditions
3. Write the pruned strategies into a file

## Hypotheses

- OR conditions need to be flattened into two or more separate strategies for each possibility
- Contradictory conditions should be removed, i.e., paths like "phone=5 & phone=7" are not allowed

## Requirements
- Python >3.12 (new type hint annotations)

## Usage

To run the program, you need to specify at least one argument:
- The path to the DV tree file using the `-f` or `--dv-tree-file-path` argument
- The path to the output strategies file using `-o` or `--strategies-file-path` argument. By default, the program sets this value to `strategies.txt`

### Preferred Setup with Poetry

It is recommended to use **Poetry** to manage dependencies and run the program. If you don't have Poetry installed, follow the [Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

```bash
poetry run dv_strategies -f /path/to/your/dv_tree_file.txt
```

### Alternative Setup (Without Poetry)
If you prefer not to use Poetry, make sure you have Python 3.12 installed.

```bash
python process_dv_tree.py -f /path/to/your/dv_tree_file.txt
```

## Test Instructions
You need to flatten the attached tree ( tree_to_convert.txt ) into a set of strategies.

A strategy is a combination of :

- a strategy definition : a sequence of conditions of the form "{feature} = {value}" or
"{feature} != {value}" separated with "and" operators only.
    - e.g : "phone=12 & language=2 & size!=300x600"
- a leaf value

The syntax of a strategy is given by {strategy definition}:{leaf_value}.

## Modalities
- Your script should be coded in Python
- You have to code a function which takes the tree_to_convert.txt file as input, flattens
it, and writes the output strategies into another strategies.txt file.
- Your function needs to be generic. It could take as input any tree of the same
structure. You can assume similar tree will have :
    - only OR conditions
    - only = != operators
    - various variables names (only letters) and tree depth
- Your script shouldnâ€™t return impossible strategies:
    - "phone=5 & phone=7" is not allowed
- Your script should simplify strategies when possible :
    - "value=4" is better than "value!=3 & value=4"
- The operator "&" is the only operator allowed in a strategy

## Example

Leaf 4 translates into the following strategy : 
"device_type!=pc & browser!=7 & browser=8 : 0.000881108"\
Which is then simplified in : "device_type!=pc & browser=8 : 0.000881108"
